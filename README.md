# UFOs
---------------------------------------
## Overview of Project:
### This project was to create a more in-depth search critera for the web page in order to have a more dynamic table to search from.
### So we will be building a function that will help us filter out all the criteras for the data to be displayed.

## Results: 
### Our first result is our front-end webpage, this page gives us a good overview and with the added bonus of having a dark background in order for us to see our page better and fit the theme of space and ufo's.

### Our next results allows us to enter the desired date of our table. Which the page changes accordingly when being inputed.

### Our next results allows us to enter the desired city of our table. Which changes the page accordingly when being inputed.

### Our next results allows us to enter the desired state of our table. Which changes the page accordingly when being inputed.

### Our next results allows us to enter the desired shape of our table. Which changes the page accordingly when being inputed.

## Summary: 
### One draw back of this filtering is knowing what input to be using which could make things much harder to search without the right parameters. 
### A recommendation I would suggust would be to have a button that shows all of the avaliable countries, state, shapes, and datas in order to not waste time looking back at the inital data to see whats avaliable.
